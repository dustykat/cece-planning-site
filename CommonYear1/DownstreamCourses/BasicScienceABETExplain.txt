 
Explanation of the BSCE basic science elective from ABET documents

For the additional area of basic science, programs may include areas such as biology, ecology, geology or meteorology, all areas of significant interest and increasing importance for civil engineers. This list is not inclusive, hence it is not necessary all students within a particular program’s curriculum take the same additional area of science. However, for topics other than those listed above, the program must demonstrate the selected area(s) of science provides breadth beyond physics and chemistry. In general, an advanced course in physics or chemistry (i.e., a course that is part of a sequence for which a course serves as a prerequisite) would not fulfill this requirement because such a course would provide additional depth rather than additional breadth. Still, programs should have a degree of flexibility in choosing basic science courses that meet the breath requirement. Courses such as geo-physics, seismology, organic or bio-chemistry that are not part of a standard physics or chemistry sequence might be appropriate, especially if they can be tied to student outcomes and program’s curricular emphasis. Likewise, a course primarily engineering science in content would not fulfill this requirement. Courses such as thermodynamics, computer science or materials science do not meet this requirement and this is a long-term norm.
