            <h2>CECE Python Support Site on AWS Lightsail</h2>
Welcome to the CECE python support site.
This site is created to provide supplimental materials for students in ENGR-1330 Computational Thinking and Data Science, 
as well as other students in WCOE who may have a need to do some programming in their other courses.  
At the present this site hosts a python 3.8 and R kernel in the JupyterLab Notebook environment.  
        
The site is hosted on an Amazon Web Services Lightsail Instance and is not using TTU hardware or network infrastructure; as such users should not store any personal information.  Backups are infrequent; and the service may be terminated at the end of any month.  
        
This is mostly an experiment to build a fully containerized software environment for teaching

                <div class="panel">
<p>        This is a website that is a library of worked python/ipython solutions to specific, narrow-scope, problems.  
        The intent is that one can construct meaningful programs by gathering the needed examples here, binding them, and running their own unique problems. </p>
        
<p>    The directories are organized into single topics.
        
        Within each directory there will be an HTML file, which is the notebook run once through a rendering program to make a static content file -- i.e. what the notebook should look like without errors (syntax errors are suppressed).
        
        The notebook itself is the <em>filename.ipynb</em> file.  There is a <em>.tar</em> file which can be downloaded, extracted, and run on your own instance of JupyterLab on your own machine.
    
    <p>The collection of notebooks, is categorized by topic.  The link will take you to the directory where the notebook is housed, something like the image below. </p>
            <img src="./NotebookDirectory.png" style="width:50%">
	</p>
<p>If you simply want to look at the notebook, rendered as a web page, select the .html file.  Otherwise select and download the .ipynb file.  If there are other files, they are usually needed too.  In complete examples with multiple files required there will be a .zip file which will contain all the depnedencies, download that file, extract and you can run the notebook.</p>

<p>The notebook directory is also replicated on remote shared instances that you can access and run the notebooks yourself</p>
