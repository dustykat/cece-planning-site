# ## Background
# 
# Nature (Biologically) inspired engineering design uses analogs to natural (biological) systems to develop solutions for engineering problems and can be beneficial for developing sustainable solutions to engineering problems. The innate complexity of natural systems can inspire engineers attempting to create designs involving higher levels of complexity. Several bio-inspired designs have been used in solving problems, such as the imitation of the design of pinecones to design body heat regulating clothes and the design of micro-robots that can walk on water mimicking the basilisk lizard.
