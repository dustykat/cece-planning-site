# Welcome to the CECE Instructor Problem Library

This site is intended is a collection of problem examples for faculty in CECE to use to mainstream applications of ENGR-1320 Biologically Inspired Design, ENGR-1330 Computational Thinking with Data Science, and ENGR-2392 Engineering Ethics and Its Impact on Society into later courses in the CECE curriculum.

:::{note}
The WCOE mandates a common first year experience, the three formal courses in that experience are:

- ENGR 1330 Computational Thinking with Data Science
- ENGR 1320 Biologically Inspired Design (Nature Inspired Design)
- ENGR 2392 Engineering Ethics and Its Impact on Society (Social Technological)

Downstream use of the concepts in these course is thematically expected, and will serve to ...

In searching the literature the developer found lots of philosophical discussions and citations to untraceable documents on the subjects but no examples -- NONE!  

So this collection is a start.

## Intended Audience
This collection is intended for CECE faculty to leverage concetps in the Year 1 common theme in later courses.  
The current concept (circa 2021) is one or two homework assignments, appropriately chosen, topically relevant where students are tasked with using the tools they developed in the first year experience, in later courses.

Suitable exercises are provided herein and are some variant of:

- Read and summarize a case study; identify and critique ethical conflicts, unanticipated impacts on society 
- Solve ordinary homework problems using methods and tools (aka Jupyter Notebooks) from computational thinking experiences
- Identify similarities in currect design methods to nature inspired design (assuming nature is an energy minimization process)
- Others as this document evolves


:::{note}
The library is developed and built using a Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB) running Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS
The document itself is created using Jupyter Notebooks as source files, just like the tools presented in ENGR-1330.

The deployment site is hosted on an AWS Lightsail Instance [fqdn-url-here]

## Organization
The collection is organized by CECE course where a downstream application is identified.  
The attribution of the library is to the department.
The copyright type is creative commons.
Most of the problems are supplied by CECE faculty (who are named as contribuitors).
> Naming individual faculty is both to acknowledge the shared contribution and to shame all faculty to participate.
> For faculty outside TTU who contribute, their pages will show name, and affiliation (and those pages should be treated as their intellectual property)
Where multiple examples (per course) are available the course number repeats.
