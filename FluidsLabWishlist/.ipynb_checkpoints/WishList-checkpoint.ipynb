    "|[Reynolds Demonstration](https://sunlabtech.com/osborne-reynolds-demonstration/)|Demonstrate Osborne Reynolds dye experiments and subsequent invention of the dimensonless group that characterizes laminar, transitional, and turbulent flow regimes. <br> - Uses 1.0 X 0.5 meters of bench space.  Will fit in current lab space without much fuss<br>|\n",
    "|[Cake (Plate-and-Frame) Filtration](http://www.usdidactic.com/html/p3428.htm)|Illustrates deep bed filtration and cake (forming on a septum) filtration. <br> - A unit process at larger scale than typical benchtop filtration, plus deep bed.  <br> - Combine with a turbidimeter to illustrate breakthrough (in deep bed).  <br> - Illustrate dead end filtration and deliquoring <br> - Demonstrate cycle-time analysis <br> - Uses 2.0 x 1.0 meters of floor space <br>|\n",
    "|[Hydrographs after Precipitation](http://www.usdidactic.com/html/p3427.htm#)|This would be a nice addition to the laboratory suite.  <br> - Uses 1.6 X 1.0 meter of floor space <br> - Has odd way to  time-varying flow, but rest of apparatus is cool<br>|\n",
    "|[Water Hammer in Pipes](http://www.usdidactic.com/html/p3187.htm#)|A transient flow experiment <br> - Can develop data and analyze using rigid-column theory or elastic pipe theory <br> - Uses 1.0 X 1.0 meter of floor space<br>|\n",
